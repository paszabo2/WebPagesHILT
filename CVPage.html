 <h1>Academic Service</h1>
 <p><a href='http://libguides.owu.edu/culturecafe'>Culture Cafe</a></P>
	<ul>
		<li>A student centered

activity that seeks to create connections with the OWU student community 

by expanding the library’s role as a place where discovery thrives. Culture 

Café is related to the evolving concept of ‘library as place’ in which the library 

experience expands beyond its traditional boundaries. In this case, we push on 

those boundaries in the spirit of intellectual curiosity. Culture Café features 

performances of a wide variety, including music, poetry, and dance. It is held at 

least once per semester from 8-9pm on a Thursday evening in the main library's cafe.</li>
